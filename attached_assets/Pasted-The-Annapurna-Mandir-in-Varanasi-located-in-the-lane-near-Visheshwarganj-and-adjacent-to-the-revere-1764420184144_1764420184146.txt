The Annapurna Mandir in Varanasi, located in the lane near Visheshwarganj and adjacent to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple, is dedicated to Goddess Annapurna — the Divine Mother who ensures that her devotees are never deprived of food. With a golden ladle in one hand and a bowl of rice in the other, she is worshipped as the provider of nourishment and sustenance. The name itself holds meaning: Anna means food, while Purna means fullness or completeness. As a form of Goddess Parvati, she plays an essential role in the spiritual and mythological fabric of Kashi (Varanasi).


Key Features & Administration
•	The Annapurna Devi Mandir was built in 1729 A.D. by the Maratha ruler Peshwa Baji Rao I, in the Nagara architectural style. 
•	Within its large pillared sanctum are two idols of the Goddess: one brass, available for darshan every day, and another gold, shown to devotees only once annually on Annakut (the day after Diwali). 
•	The temple design follows the Panchayatana layout, meaning there are subsidiary shrines too — dedicated to deities like Ganesha, Kubera, Surya, Yantreshwar Mahadev, Satyanarayan, and Hanuman among them. 



Beliefs
•	One popular legend says that Parvati, seeking to restore her fair form (Gauri) after a disagreement with Shiva, was instructed by Shiva to distribute food in Varanasi. Adopting the form of Annapurna, she provided nourishment in the holy city. 
•	Another telling is that Shiva once declared that everything, including food, is maya (illusion). Disturbed by this, Parvati made all food vanish, causing suffering. Realizing the importance of sustenance, Shiva eventually begged Parvati at her door. Parvati then relented, feeding the world and setting up her kitchen in Varanasi. It is through this myth that Annapurna is celebrated as essential to life and well-being. 


Festivals, Rituals & Access
•	Annakut (the day after Diwali) is the most important festival for the temple. On this day, the golden idol is unveiled for public worship, and special offerings (Annakut coins) are distributed to devotees. 
•	During Navratri (in both October and April), the temple receives large crowds for special pujas. 
•	The temple premises are maintained by the Kashi Annapurna Annakshetra Trust, which also runs social service activities: free food (annadaan), elderly care, medical clinics, education, and more. 
•	The temple’s location: House No. D-9/1, Vishwanath Gali, roughly 15 meters north-west of Kashi Vishwanath Temple. It is about 5 km from Varanasi Junction railway station. 


Veda / Purāṇa Connection
Here is what can be gathered from Purāṇic / Paurāṇic (and related) sources, and what is not explicitly found, to give better understanding and possible links:
•	The temple is not clearly named in the major Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda). There are no direct references in those texts that mention “Annapurna Temple, Varanasi” by that name.
•	However, the Skanda Purāṇa, especially the Kashi Khand section, is rich in narratives about Kashi (Varanasi) and its deities. It mentions the spiritual greatness of Kashi, its temples, and the divine family of Shiva and his consort in multiple forms. The temple trust website for Annapurna Temple states that as per Skanda Purāṇa, “as long as Kashi exists, Lord Vishwanath (Shiva) and Goddess Annapurna have influence throughout the world.” 
•	There is mention in some devotional literature (and blogs quoting Kashi Khand) that Annapurna (also called Bhavani Gauri in older tradition) is considered one of the forms of Parvati residing in Kashi. Over time, Annapurna came to be specifically worshipped as the Goddess who nourishes, while Bhavani Gauri became less invoked in that specific role. 
•	Some texts/legends say that the worship of Annapurna with certain practices (e.g. offering food, annadan) is especially meritorious in Kashi, and that Annapurna is called the queen of Kashi — acting as complement (Shakti) to Kashi Vishwanath.

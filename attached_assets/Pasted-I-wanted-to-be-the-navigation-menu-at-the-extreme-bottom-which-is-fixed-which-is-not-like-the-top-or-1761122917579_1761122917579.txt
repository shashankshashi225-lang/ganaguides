I wanted to be the navigation menu at the extreme bottom which is fixed which is not like the top or hamburg menu I wanted like horizontal all five options to be fixed home packages destination blog about and then the Whatsapp booking integration option And in the top at the left corner there would be Ganga gates at the right corner there would be plan your journey if the person clicks on Ganga Guides it is the main logo wherever the person is it should take him to the home page And please remove at the top corner at the top menu what you have added now that is one change

With respect to the plan your spiritual journey contact form at the last it is looking very plain I want it to be much more looking attractive

So the next thing I feel this website and colors font animations are very boring help me to improve that as well I am right now describing only about the scrolling home page nothing other than that if I have more I'll tell you but let's fix this first

So when we go to the packages option first it'll be just showing the main heading one day Kashi Darshan OK below that it will just display the description OK when the user takes his cursor or hand towards that then the details will flip up It is an animation first it'll have very less description and then when they click on that it should display a detailed and same goes with all of them if they click on that it should have a very the title and a basic description and when they hover on it it should get the whole details ask me if you get more questions on this so when it comes to destinations

So when it comes to destination if the user wants he can also book based on the destination also make something like that
So it is not like we'll just offer the details for book now for destinations when they open it after opening and reading their destination if they want they can book in the initial destination will serve just as a guide something like that for them to read about that place But in future if they want to continue with us they can book it from us something like that it will be like a actual guide itself just text guide if they want they can book it just an option optional for them so it'll be not too much focused but it'll be given

Also let's talk about the reviews that menu is like very simple very very simple I want that to be much more unique different So yeah let's work on these things in this cutter and iteration and then let's start with the building

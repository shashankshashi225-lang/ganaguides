## ✅ **FINAL SUMMARIZED PROMPT (Use this when restarting the Agent)**

**You are building my full-stack web app. Here are all the features and issues that need to be implemented and fixed in this iteration:**

---

### **1. Fix All Mobile Layout & Spacing Issues**

* Remove the white space on the right side in mobile view

#### **Panchang Requirements:**

* A mini **monthly calendar card**

  * Amavasya
  * Purnima
  * Festivals
* When user **clicks a highlighted date**, show a popup with:

  * Event name
  * Date
  * Description
  * Relevance for travel/puja
* This section updates every month
* I will add/edit events directly in **Neon PostgreSQL**, not through an admin panel

#### **Database table for events:**

`events`

* id
* date
* event_name
* description
* type (Amavasya/Purnima/Festival/etc.)

### **7. Fix App Crashes & Missing Secrets**

* Debug and fix the issue causing:
  *“The app failed to run, please debug and fix it”*

### **8. All Buttons Should Work**

* Proper routing (wouter)
* Smooth navigation
* Everything clickable must function

---

### **9. Build All This in ONE ITERATION**

If you want, I can also make:

* A shorter version

Just tell me.

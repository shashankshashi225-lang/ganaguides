https://www.instagram.com/gangaguide/p/DPiuY01E1EE/ This is one of the link I want you to add to Instagram for the reviews what's their experience Add this and then I did not like the animation which you have used in the reviews what they are saying it is like very big the main one is too big the borders are very big make it much more like animated about spiritual which looks good and also make sure the whole website would be functional from now the whole website every button on this should redirect and then they should work in the right way each and every button should be working now So if you have more questions to ask you can ask for example whether if it is a destination section or the blog section if I click on Read full guide it should redirect me to a new page where it has all the details of that and I should be able to edit those contents as well we'll talk about it in the future iteration but make sure now it is functional and make the UI much more smoother Ask me questions if you have

I'll help you improve the website! Let me first explore the current codebase to understand the structure, then I'll ask you some clarifying questions to make sure I implement everything correctly.
No you want to add it as the Instagram review content as a testimonial you need to add the video itself not the video link this video should be directly displayed This is for the Instagram video kind of thing I told yeah you can use after gentle fade animation Whatever you feel is good you can use it for animation style For the detailed pages of destination guides yeah you need to just redirect to a new page which has an image and the descriptions of that particular destination Yeah to store and edit this you need to create a database neon it should have a picture and then space for two more 3 more pictures that should be optional if that is not added it will not be shown the empty space and then the text and they can share it also on WhatsApp instagram and copy link they should be there on the destinations

Yeah every page should have Whatsapp integration facility Yes the same goes with blog page destination page and the package page Yes you are right what you asked Hope I have cleared all your questions You can build all these in one iteration only because I don't have much memory You can build all these in the current iteration
